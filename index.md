I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 8 - Part 1
Lab 8 was my favorite because I liked the concept of using nested loops to solve the problem of writing a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector. One thing I had to learn was how to correctly apply the push_back function. I also learned how to use the command line arguments using int values. One challenge I faced was how to apply the command-line arguments within the for loops but once I understood the first one, it was easier to apply it to other ones. 

Lab 3- Part 2
Lab 3 Part 2 was also one of my favorites because I liked how we made calculating the days between two dates very simple and quick rather than time-consuming. One thing I learned was how to apply the Julian Days formula to the coding format. One challenge I faced was putting the wrong numbers in the wrong place for which I had to change and edit a couple of times in order to have all the tests pass. 

Lab 7 
Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs as well because it allowed me to think about how coding can be applied conceptually in the real world. I found this lab much more interesting and challenging because of its importance in todayâ€™s world. The most challenging bit was to figure out how to apply the static_cast functions to fit the context of the assignment but once we figured that out, the work was much easier.
